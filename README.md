"YouNight" is the tentative name of the project. 

The idea of ​​the project is to shorten the path between a person looking for a party or an event, and private institutions / event organizers, who want to make their parties and events known.

The application will be made to develop the visibility and communication of private institutions / event organizers, but also for ease to any users, their personal searches of evenings to orient themselves to go out, or simply be a spectator at a distance of evenings.

The goal is to push people to virtualization for research and sharing their evenings.

In addition, the application would allow anyone who is in a private place in the evening to make contact with the world by taking advantage of the popularity of the private place in which it is (via private lives launched on the channel of the establishment in question with its authorization)

People love to show themselves and share their moments. This application goes in this direction, it will allow people to be easily seen through this additional visibility that private institutions will acquire through their listing on this application.

Part of their clientele would be willing to pay to rent equipped tables, made available by the institutions to be seen live on the application and to interact with the world via a tablet made available.

The application in question will not allow to make lives outside this context. You will need to be present at a YouNight affiliate site to use YouNight.
